# PDE Solver_ Group DH

# Project Overview
In this project we are trying to obtain the steady state solution of the 2D Heat Equation by solving Laplacian (Temperature)=0. 

# General Comments
- No external library required 
- Python 3 required for visualization

# Problem Formulation
- Consider a square plate with length: L=1m and height: H=1m.
(Image)
- All the edges are maintained at different temperatures and the user is allowed to set these values at runtime. Initially there will be temperature redistribution, but at t= infinity, the temperature of all nodes will come to a steady value.

- Default grid: 100 x 100 (equally spaced in both directions).
